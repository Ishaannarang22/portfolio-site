    "bio": "Hi, I'm Ishaan. I study Computer Science at Penn State and focus on AI interpretability research. As secretary of the Google Developers Club, I enjoy working on creative projects and learning alongside others. I'm always looking for something new to learn, whether it's exploring a new area in tech, the latest trends, or a tricky chess opening. I love challenging myself and believe the best ideas come from working together. Outside of class, you'll find me cooking, playing chess and badminton, hitting the gym, or just enjoying a good cup of coffee with friends. I'm curious by nature and always up for a good conversation about AI, coffee, or anything in between.",
